<p id="description">Welcome to MoviesMess the website for those days when you just can’t be bothered to get up and live your own life. Why try skydiving or hiking when you can dive deep into an endless catalog of movies you’ll swear you’ve been meaning to watch? Here we pride ourselves on making sure you’ll spend more time choosing a movie than actually watching it. Our selections range from 'That Classic Everyone Pretends They’ve Seen' to 'Why Was This Even Made?'. So grab your popcorn (or don't – you’ll probably be too busy scrolling) and prepare for an evening of indecisive bliss and cinematic judgment.</p>
